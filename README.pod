=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<lemonbar> [-h | -O | -g I<width>B<x>I<height>B<+>I<x>B<+>I<y> | -b | -d | -f I<font> | -p | -n I<name> | -B I<color> | -F I<color> | -o I<offset> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<lemonbar> (formerly known as B<bar>) is a lightweight bar entirely based on XCB. Provides full UTF-8 support, basic formatting, RandR support and EWMH compliance without wasting your precious memory.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h>

Display the help and exit.

=item B<-g> I<width>B<x>I<height>B<+>I<x>B<+>I<y>

Set the window geometry. If a parameter is omitted it's filled with the default value. If the I<y> parameter is specified along with the B<-b> switch then the position is relative to the bottom of the screen.

=item B<-O> I<name>

Set next output to I<name>. May be used multiple times; order is significant. If any B<-O> options are given, only B<-O> specified monitors will be used. Invalid output names are silently ignored. (only supported on randr configurations at this time)

=item B<-b>

Dock the bar at the bottom of the screen.

=item B<-d>

Force docking without asking the window manager. This is needed if the window manager isn't EWMH compliant.

=item B<-f> I<font>

Define the font to load into one of the ten slots (the number of slots is hardcoded and can be tweaked by
changing the MAX_FONT_COUNT parameter in the source code). This version supports fontconfig font specifiers and anti-aliased fonts.

=item B<-a> I<number>

Set initial number of clickable areas (default is 10).
Whenever the number of clickable areas is used up, the amount of clickable areas doubles.

=item B<-p>

Make the bar permanent, don't exit after the standard input is closed.

=item B<-n> I<name>

Set the WM_NAME atom value for the bar.

=item B<-B> I<color>

Set the background color of the bar. I<color> must be specified in the hex format (#aarrggbb, #rrggbb, #rgb). If no compositor such as compton or xcompmgr is running the alpha channel is silently ignored.

=item B<-F> I<color>

Set the foreground color of the bar. Accepts the same color formats as B<-B>.

=item B<-o> I<offset>

Add a vertical offset to the text. I<offset> must be a number and can be negative. I<-o -3> will push the text 3 pixels up.

=back

=head1 FORMATTING

lemonbar provides a screenrc-inspired formatting syntax to allow full customization at runtime. Every formatting block is opened with C<%{> and closed by C<}> and accepts the following commands, the parser tries its best to handle malformed input. Use C<%%> to get a literal percent sign (C<%>).

=over

=item B<R>

Swap the current background and foreground colors.

=item B<l>

Aligns the following text to the left side of the screen.

=item B<c>

Aligns the following text to the center of the screen.

=item B<r>

Aligns the following text to the right side of the screen.

=item B<O>I<width>

Offset the current position by I<width> pixels in the alignment direction.

=item B<B>I<color>

Set the text background color. The parameter I<color> can be I<-> or a color in one of the formats mentioned before. The special value I<-> resets the color to the default one.

=item B<F>I<color>

Set the text foreground color. The parameter I<color> can be I<-> or a color in one of the formats mentioned before. The special value I<-> resets the color to the default one.

=item B<A>I<button>:I<command>:

Create a clickable area starting from the current position, when the area is clicked I<command> is printed on stdout. The area is closed when a B<A> token, not followed by : is encountered.

Eg. I<%{A:reboot:} Click here to reboot %{A}>

The I<button> field is optional, it defaults to the left button, and it's a number ranging from 1 to 7 which maps to the left, middle, right, scroll up, scroll down, hover enter, and hover leave movements. Your mileage may vary.

Nested clickable areas can trigger different commands.

Eg. I<%{A:reboot:}%{A3:halt:} Left click to reboot, right click to shutdown %{A}%{A}>

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

Clicking on an area makes lemonbar output the command to stdout, followed by a newline, allowing the user to pipe it into a script, execute it or simply ignore it. Simple and powerful, that's it.
